I am thrilled to share my recent project as part of a online training program with CipherSchools. This comprehensive training allowed me to dive deep into various cutting-edge technologies. Throughout the program, I completed multiple assignments, attended live lectures, doubt sessions, and insightful guest lectures focused on career 

development, resume building, and industry trends. It was an incredible learning journey that culminated in this final project.

The experience of applying theoretical knowledge into practical application has been immensely rewarding. 

ðŸ’¼ Purpose: This project is part of my graduation requirement, and I have been tasked with sharing it on LinkedIn. I am excited to present it to my network and look forward to your feedback.

I am grateful to CipherSchools for this wonderful opportunity and to all the mentors and peers who supported me throughout this journey.
